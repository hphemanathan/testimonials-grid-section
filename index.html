          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny‚Äôs worth. ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined
          the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a transition and have heard
          some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the
          free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
          thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time
          of my life. Since completing the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched
          careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

          total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
          Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
          easy. ‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I
          find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary
          to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
          junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
          personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and
          amazing people. ‚Äù

          Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended! ‚Äú Before joining
          the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some
          structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by
          step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can
          only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
          staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
          wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
          outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
          tutorial could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during
          interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly
          helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
          multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
